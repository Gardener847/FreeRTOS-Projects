# FreeRTOS-Projects

## About the Projects

1) The projects show a simple example of how to use certain hardware protocols, such as UART, SPI, and I2C.
2) Additionally, the projects touch on concepts relating to ADC, PWM, task priority scheduling and handling, nested interrupt vector controller, bitmasking, state machines, semaphors, mutexes, and queues.
3) All the projects use the [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/index.html) and [LPC17xx](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10360.pdf) framework to interface with the board's ARM Cortex M3 processor.
